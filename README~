I)	What is AutoMap ?
-------------------------

	AutoMap is a cool 3D map generator and viewer that lets you
generate 3D landscapes using a 2D picture that look's like a topology
map. It can be used to other aspects such as generate 3D models for an
external 3D software.

	AutoMap has been developed by UMAD team (see V-Credits) as
a second year school project at Epita.

	It uses a modified version of glMLite, lablgtk and ocamlsdl.
Automap has been realized using OCaml language.


II)	How to Compile
-----------------------

Required packages :
 - ocaml-native-compilers
 - libsdl-ocaml-dev
 - libsdl-ocaml
 - libmagickcore-dev
 - libmagickcore3
 - lablgtk2-ocaml-dev
 - lablgtk2-ocaml

If you never used glMLite :
	First go to glMLite-0.03.50 directory
	 - use "make"
	 - use "make vbo"
	 - use "make genimg"
	 - use "sudo make install"
	 - use "sudo make install_vbo"
	 - use "sudo make install_genimg"
Otherwise :
	glMLite-0.03.50/SRC/GL.ml:
		external glClientActiveTexture: texture:texture_i -> unit = "ml_glclientactivetexture" "noalloc"
		(** {{:http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml}
	glMLite-0.03.50/SRC/GL.ml.pp:
		external glClientActiveTexture: texture:texture_i -> unit = "ml_glclientactivetexture" NOALLOC
		(** {{:http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml}
	glMLite-0.03.50/SRC/GL.mli:
		external glClientActiveTexture: texture:texture_i -> unit = "ml_glclientactivetexture" "noalloc"
		(** {{:http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml}
	glMLite-0.03.50/SRC/gl.wrap.c:
		t_val ml_glclientactivetexture( value _texture_i )
		glClientActiveTexture( texture_i ); ret


Then, go to automap root directory and use "make" to generate the bytecode
Use ./automap to launch AutoMap once compiled

III)	How to use
-------------------

 - Launch AutoMap using ./automap or by double clicking on 
   automap icon.

 - Once launched, you'll see a gtk interface showing multiple buttons.
   Start with the first one : load an image. Select your image and then
   click "Ok"

 - Your image is shown, you have multiple choices : 
	-> Clear noise, applies a noise reduction algorithm

	-> Border, lets you detect borders and chose color heights later
		-> use "Simple Grid" to generate a basic 3D mesh.
		   You are able to adjust heights of a specific color (only if
		   you previously clicked on "Border", otherwise you will only
		   see the grid step entry)

	-> Canny, applies a Sobel mask and lets you click on areas to determines
	   easly what is the height of a specific color with the 2 sliders at
	   the bottom of the image.
		-> Once you entirely filled the image press on the "Finalize" 
		   button that will fill outlines.

 - There is 2 main mesh generation algorithm : Simple Grid and QuadTree.
   Chose one and follow instructions.

 - Click on "3D" to launch the OpenGL viewer of the generated mesh


IV)	Other usages
---------------------

	You can use AutoMap only as a 3D mesh generator from a 2D
picture. Indeed, AutoMap generates a Wavefront file (*.obj) compatible
with other 3D modelling software such as Blender.
