I)	What is AutoMap ?
-------------------------

	AutoMap is a cool 3D map generator and viewer that lets you
generate 3D landscapes using a 2D picture that look's like a topology
map. It can be used to other aspects such as generate 3D models for an
external 3D software.

	AutoMap has been developed by UMAD team (see V-Credits) as
a second year school project at Epita.

	It uses lablgl, lablgtk and ocamlsdl. Automap has been realized using OCaml language.


II)	How to Compile
-----------------------

Required packages :
 - ocaml-native-compilers
 - libsdl-ocaml-dev
 - libsdl-ocaml
 - lablgl-ocaml-dev
 - lablgl-ocaml
 - lablgtk2-ocaml-dev
 - lablgtk2-ocaml

Use "make" to generate the bytecode
Use ./automap to launch AutoMap once compiled

III)	How to use
-------------------

 - Launch AutoMap using ./automap or by double clicking on 
   automap icon.

 - Once launched, you'll see a gtk interface showing multiple buttons.
   Start with the first one : load an image. Select your image and then
   click "Ok"

 - Your image is showed. Click on "Border" to compute borders, then 
   "Grid" to generate the 3D mesh.

 - Click on "Relief" to launch the OpenGL viewer of the generated mesh

 -> Lateral buttons are only here for future updates. It shows another
    algorithm of border detection, and a future feature that needs 
    blurring algorithms.


IV)	Other usages
---------------------

	You can use AutoMap only as a 3D mesh generator from a 2D
picture. Indeed, AutoMap generates a Wavefront file (*.obj) compatible
with other 3D modelling software such as Blender.
